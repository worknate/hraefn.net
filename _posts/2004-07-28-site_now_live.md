[Hraefn.net](http://www.hraefn.net) finally went live with the new design, blog, etc. yesterday.  Updates to the Projects page to close off broken links, except for the Miata section, which I hope to get up tonight or tomorrow sometime.  I certainly have enough pictures by now!

Contact me to give me some feedback on the design.  I like the look of the bird-man at the top; kind of refects a cynical, angry view which is probably about half of my writings.  Something with a raven''s head should work well, wouldn''t you think?  Erin things he''s kind of scary.  Sweet!
