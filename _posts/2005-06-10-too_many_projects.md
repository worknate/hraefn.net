[Something](https://www.worldofwarcraft.com) has been occupying almost all of my free time the past few months.

I really need to update my Projects page.  The "new" car has been occupying a great deal of my attention recently.  The past week I bled the brakes, changed the radiator fluid and oil, installed a new battery and cleaned out the trunk.  Removed a ton of rust with a wire wheel attachment on my cordless drill.  Also tried to air it out a little more; the poor thing gets a bit musty inside because of the leak in the trunk.

Found a really cool source for [replacement seat belts](http://www.WescoPerformance.com). I ordered a pair of non-retractable 3-point belts to replace the terrible factory belts. The belts seem of acceptable sturdiness and should work well. I may actually try them out in the Miata because

1. retractable mechanisms add weight
2. the adjustment method could mean a very snug fit
3. unlike a race harness, a policeman would never notice these

Now I need the hood painted and pinstripes removed to make it into a half-decent twenty-footer.  The brake pad shims are also badly rusted and I need to clean them up, along with either new caliper pins or a serious amount of rust removal and caliper grease.  The stock black steelies do not look bad though.

My DVR project has stagnated now since November 2004 despite the addition of a Hauppauge WinTV PVR-350. I even have a new Sony Trinitron 30" HDTV now... but no DVR capabilities.
