I found some time to start the install for my Triumph heated grips. While the kit came with a harness, the Thruxton appeared to be pre-wired.

I really wanted to use the existing plugs, but there is just not enough slack to draw the plug back through the bars. If I managed to connect the plugs _inside_ the bars, how difficult would removal be in the future? My guess is the factory harness is also used with other bikes. It makes no sense otherwise.

I decided to undo the factory wiring harness for the left side, to explore my options. To understand why I needed more slack, here is the relevant bit from the instructions, which uses the harness provided with the kit:

This is inside the left-hand harness:

Which juuuuuust gives enough slack:

I considered creating some extenders for the factory harness. The connectors are JST JWPF; 4-pin on the left, 2-pin on the right. But I worried about getting the extra plugs and wire to fit within the controls.

Replacing the harness sheathing was harder than I expected. The "flexible" heat-shrink tubing I tried was far too stiff. I ended up ordering harness tubing from http://www.cycleterminal.com/ which is thinner than OEM but worked well. To use the non-shrink tubing, I had to remove the plugs at the headlight end. This is how you remove pins from a JST JWPF connector:

I was really concerned about the throttle-side wires getting cut; the hole provided by Triumph is sharp and others have reported having problems. I widened and smoothed the hole with my dremel and some 500-grit sandpaper. There seems to be no binding after install.

I removed the extra left-side wiring and plug, but ignored the right-side... I didn't feel like cutting into a second harness.
