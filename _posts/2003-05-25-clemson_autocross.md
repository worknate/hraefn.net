Bought and had installed 205/50-15 Falken Azenis with 15x6.5 Konig Heliums in bronze. Added a front lip spoiler (scrape!) from Trussville Maza. Probably the most comfortable addition is the 330mm Isotta “Monte Carlo” steering wheel.

The Miata ran near-perfect at the recent Clemson Autocross, less than two seconds from fastest time of the day.  The Falkens really hook up well.  Ran with the AGXs at 4F, 6R.
