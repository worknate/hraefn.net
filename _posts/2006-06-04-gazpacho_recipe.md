### Ingredients

* 5 large fresh tomatoes (about 4lbs) - peeled (braized) and seeded  
* 1 large cucumber - peeled, seeded  
* 1 large green pepper - seeded  
* 3 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley  
* 1 cup chopped sweet (vidalia) onion  
* 3 small green onions - sliced thin  
* 1 clove garlic - minced  
* 1/2 cup vinegar  
* 1/2 cup olive oil  
* 2 Tbsp lemon juice  
* 3 packets Splenda (sugar works too)  
* 1 Tbsp black pepper  
* 1 can tomato soup  
* 3 cups hot beef broth

### Directions

Chop the fresh tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, parsley and onions. Set one half of vegetables to one side.

Combine tomato soup (include water per typical soup directions) and garlic with other half of vegetables in a blender. Blend well.

Add remaining ingredients.  Make sure the broth is hot, but do not melt your container! Stir well.

Salt may be added to taste, but remember that the tomato soup and broth probably have plenty.

Refrigerate until cold, preferably overnight, preferably in a sealed container.

Serve cold in a short glass or cup; a great summer appetizer, snack, or side with meals.
