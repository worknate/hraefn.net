Came across [TeamSpeex](http://www.savvy.nl/blog/2005/10/16/teamspeex-open-beta/) last week. The program is a clean little Teamspeak client, and worked fine with both of the guild servers that I tried... once I updated to OS X 10.4 (Tiger)

Looks like the author is working towards an update for 10.3.x, which would be nice, because [Dashboard](http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/macosxhints/2005/08/disabledashboard/index.php) **makes baby Jesus cry**.

Update: reading down through the comments from Savvy''s blog shows that the **non-Unicode** [version](http://www.savvy.nl/blog/download/) _should_ work with OS X 10.3.9 (Panther)
