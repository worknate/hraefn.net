Erin and I were married on the [30th of December, 2004.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_30)  She was stunning, the [church](http://www.trinitymorgantown.org/) was beautiful, and the wedding and reception were awesome.  We owe so much to our family and friends for everything.  We are quite blessed.

Taking the next step in one's career is both exciting and a little frightening.  Not unlike marriage!  I start working for [my new employer](http://www.nuvox.com) on January 10th.
