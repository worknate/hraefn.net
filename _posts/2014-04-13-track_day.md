My co-driver and I went to a [NASA High Performance Driving Event (HPDE)](https://www.nasaproracing.com/hpde/) weekend at [Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Ohio_Sports_Car_Course). A little overwhelming. A lot of fun.

A few twenty-minute sessions over the course of two days, and you have more seat time than a year of regular autocross events. You also realize that parking lots will now be a massive disappointment.
