Did a quick search on the [iTunes Music Store](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) and found the original "Rubber Band Man" song by the [Spinners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rubberband_Man).  Hell I'll pay a buck for a song that has brought so much joy to... fans of... staplers... or something.

Also got a chance to add in BBCode-style markup to the basic portal code.  Pretty cool.  I based some of it off [cbparser](http://corz.org/blog/inc/cbparser-demo.php) but the clever things like `[url]` tags I wrote myself.
