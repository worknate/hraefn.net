[Ventrilo](http://www.ventrilo.com/) is a very popular Teamspeak-like voice application for Windows and Linux.  They have stated that a Mac client was in the works but that was over a year ago. I checked on their progress today and found an update from May 30th.

I am very interested in this because I have some issues with [Skype](http://www.skype.com/)

* No more than five people per conference call
* High system usage (bandwidth and processor) make for worsened game performance
* No way to increase or decrease the volume of particular participants
* No way to reduce quality to reduce bandwidth usage
* The creators of Skype are the creators of [Kazaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazaa).  While Skype does not appear to contain spyware or adware (_yet_) Kazaa is notorious for the horrible crap that it infects your machine with.

This is promising news, but as with most software ports of this kind *cough* Teamspeak *cough* I will believe it when I see it.

There may be [another option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gizmo5) as well, but that will require some testing.
