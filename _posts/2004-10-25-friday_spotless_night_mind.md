#### [Friday Night Lights](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390022/)

Billed as the ultimate football movie.  Lots of shakey-cam.  Emotionally moving, but I've seen more character development in a half-hour episode of [Who's the Boss](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086827/).

#### [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/)

A great movie for anyone who's ever been in love, and enjoys thought-provoking film.  Jim Carrey at probably his best... this is the first time I have been able to separate him from [Ace Ventura](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109040/). [Kirsten Dunst](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000379/) don't hurt either.
