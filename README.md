## Optimizing Photos

* For a given directory, ceate an `_originals` folder and copy all images there. Just in case
* Resize for sanity; no more than about 1500 pixels in width and 900 pixels in height
* Very tall or wide (e.g. panoramic) images should stay within about 1.5 million pixels
* Once resized, drop images into [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/howto.html)
